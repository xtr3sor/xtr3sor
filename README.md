### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Flavio Bosco, aka tr3sor. A software developer from Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·

I've started writing code being a kid, playing with languages like c++, asm, php, js and html. I never stoped and I love it.

Today, I'm (proudly) working at @PhishFort , a company that provides AntiPhishing and Brand Protection Solutions, making awesome stuff against the bad actors of the internet.
