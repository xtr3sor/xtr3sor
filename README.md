### Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Flavio Bosco, aka tr3sor. A software developer from Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·

I've started writing code being a kid, playing with languages like c++, asm, php, js and html. I never stoped and I love it.

Today, I'm (proudly) working at @PhishFort, a company that provides AntiPhishing and Brand Protection Solutions, making awesome stuff against the bad actors of the internet.

If you would like to contact me, you can write at `tr3sor [at] pm [.] me`

Thanks for read this, glhf! :D
